## Description
The volume of TV choices and streaming options can be overwhelming. Where does someone start to narrow down her choices?

TV Track allows users to cut through the clutter found on most streaming services. The home page provides a list of popular shows and a simple search interface. 

Each TV show also includes an "info" button that takes users to a page dedicated to the selected show. Users can then save any show from its dedicated page, provided they have created an account and logged in. 

The user will be told what port the app is running on and can go to `localhost:` in the web browser.

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

The application is also located on Heroku:
